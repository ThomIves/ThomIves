Thanks for coming here. Here's a bit of biography about me. I founded Integrated Machine Learning & AI - a large and growing group of data specialists and scientists seeking to learn and grow MORE TOGETHER. I actively serve the greater data science community through LinkedIn and gratefully have 42000+ followers and growing. I'm honored to be the lead data scientist at AI Strategy corporation developing an AI assisted application to improve the success rate of technical development ventures. Over my long career, I've had the honor of developing a wide range of analytical models using data, multi-physics, and experiments.
